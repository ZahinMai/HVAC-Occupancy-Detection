## Overview

In modern society, where we spend 80-90% of our time indoors, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems play a crucial role in maintaining optimal environmental conditions in various indoor spaces, including residential buildings, commercial offices, educational institutions, hospitals, and industrial facilities. 

Traditional systems often operate inefficiently, leading to unnecessary energy consumption and discomfort. For instance, when a thermostat is set to a specific temperature and the space is vacated, the system continues to run until the room reaches the set temperature, leading to unnecessary energy consumption. While motion sensors can help detect occupancy, they often fail to account for stationary occupants, resulting in discomforting scenarios where lights and systems turn off unexpectedlyâ€”a common frustration in student accommodations.

## Project Objective

This project aims to develop an advanced HVAC management system that intelligently considers multiple factors to accurately determine room occupancy. By leveraging this information, the system seeks to enhance energy efficiency and occupant comfort simultaneously. 

## Key Features

- **Data Collection Using Arduino Uno**: Utilisinf a combination of sensors to collect data on temperature, humidity, gas levels and light intensity.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Traininig a machine learning algorithm to predict occupancy using provided datasets containing similar data to that collected

## Project Structure

- **data-collection.ino**: Code for integrating various sensors used for occupancy detection.
- **occupancy-prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and machine learning part of the project.
- **/data**: Directory containing sample datasets and data processing scripts.
